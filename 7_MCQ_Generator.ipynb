There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nasChatGPT,BARD,andClaude. TheseclosedproductLLMsareheavilyfine-tunedtoalignwithhuman\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety.

We chose a binarycomparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts.

(2022):\\nLranking =−log(σ(rθ(x, yc)−rθ(x, yr))) (1)\\nwhere rθ(x, y)is the scalar score output for prompt xand completion ywith model weights θ.ycis the\\npreferred response that annotators choose and yris the rejected counterpart.\\nBuilt on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety\\nrewardmodelsasfollows.

To\\ndo so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\\nLranking =−log(σ(rθ(x, yc)−rθ(x, yr)−m(r))) (2)\\nwhere the margin m(r)is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin\\nfor pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).\\nWefoundthismargincomponentcanimproveHelpfulnessrewardmodelaccuracyespeciallyonsamples\\nwheretworesponsesaremoreseparable.

For example, instcould be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model.

Thiscaninformwhat,ifany,\\ndownstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining datafor distributionsof languages,demographic representations,and toxicity. Wealso present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly. We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsitesknowntocontainahighvolumeofpersonalinformationaboutprivateindividuals. Wemadeabest\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodelsbroadlywillreducetheneedforotherstotrainsimilarmodels.

Importantly,thisallows Llama 2-Chat togeneralizemoreeffectivelyduringsafetytuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men”than to words\\nrepresenting “women,” andGaneshetal.(2023)demonstratesthatamodel’sperformanceonfairnessmetrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups.

Weobservethat Hepronounsaregenerallyoverrepresentedindocuments\\ncomparedto Shepronouns,echoingsimilarfrequencydifferencesobservedinpronominalusageforsimilarly\\nsized modelpretraining datasets(Chowdhery etal., 2022).

Wecomputefrequenciesforeachdescriptorterminthepretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes ( Religion ,Gender and Sex ,Nationality ,Race and Ethnicity , and\\nSexual Orientation ), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as “straight,” “white,” and“black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nbothGender and Sex andSexual Orientation . ForGender and Sex , whileShepronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term “female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat whilethere isless frequent contextabout Shepronouns, commentsabout “females” are moreprevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). For Sexual\\nOrientation ,thetopfivetermsallrelatetoLGBTQ+identities. For Nationality ,RaceandEthnicity ,and\\nReligion , we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022).

We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes.

Weemployaprocesssimilartothegeneral\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1.Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning : We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthemodeltoalignwithoursafetyguidelinesevenbeforeRLHF,andthuslaysthefoundationfor\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2.Safety RLHF : Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3.SafetyContextDistillation : Finally,werefineourRLHFpipelinewithcontextdistillation(Askell\\netal.,2021b). Thisinvolvesgeneratingsafermodelresponsesbyprefixingapromptwithasafety\\npreprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentially distillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel.

We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently\\nenhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant” ).\\nLike supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s\\nresponses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.\\nSpecifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate\\nsaferresponses,andthenfine-tunethemodelonitsownsafeoutputgiventheadversarialpromptwithout\\nthe preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates.

Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto helpfurther modelsafetytraining, and specificallytook data fromthese exercisesformodel fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additionalrounds ofred teaming wereperformed over severalmonths tomeasure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally.

Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1 Learnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such as Llama 2-Chat ’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\nReward Model ScoreRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions of Llama 2-Chat , from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEvenwithproficientannotators,eachindividualwriteswithsignificantvariation.

A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsourcemodels. Open-sourcereleaseslikeBLOOM(Scaoetal.,2022),OPT(Zhangetal.,2022),andFalcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/genai_data/Llama-2.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nandAlpaca(Taorietal.,2023)adoptingauniqueapproachtotrainingwithsyntheticinstructions(Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set\\nby their closed-source counterparts.\\nInstructionTuning.

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuningdatawiththemodel’sownself-critiquesandrevisions,andbyreplacinghumanraterswitha\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges. Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked\\nwith Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards\\nlikebias,toxicity,privatedataleakage,andthepotentialformalicioususes.

The longer\\ncontextwindowenablesmodelstoprocessmoreinformation,whichisparticularlyusefulforsupporting\\nlongerhistoriesinchatapplications,varioussummarizationtasks,andunderstandinglongerdocuments.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks.

Astandardpracticeforautoregressivedecodingistocachethekey(K)and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation.

Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of 1.3.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreferencedata(i.e.,MetaSafety+Helpfulness)onaweeklybasis,consistingofover1millionbinarymodel\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g., negligibly better or unsure ) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g., significantly better ) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterativemodelupdateandpreferencedataannotationprocedure-withbetter-performing Llama 2-Chat\\nmodelsusedforresponsesamplingovertime,itbecomeschallengingforannotatorstoselectabetterone\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT.

We chose a binarycomparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts.

To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data\\ninto a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher\\nscore than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al.

However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess.

For example, instcould be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model.

As a result, Llama 2 models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men”than to words\\nrepresenting “women,” andGaneshetal.(2023)demonstratesthatamodel’sperformanceonfairnessmetrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups.

Wecomputefrequenciesforeachdescriptorterminthepretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes ( Religion ,Gender and Sex ,Nationality ,Race and Ethnicity , and\\nSexual Orientation ), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as “straight,” “white,” and“black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nbothGender and Sex andSexual Orientation . ForGender and Sex , whileShepronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term “female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat whilethere isless frequent contextabout Shepronouns, commentsabout “females” are moreprevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). For Sexual\\nOrientation ,thetopfivetermsallrelatetoLGBTQ+identities. For Nationality ,RaceandEthnicity ,and\\nReligion , we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022).

Weemployaprocesssimilartothegeneral\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1.Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning : We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthemodeltoalignwithoursafetyguidelinesevenbeforeRLHF,andthuslaysthefoundationfor\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2.Safety RLHF : Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3.SafetyContextDistillation : Finally,werefineourRLHFpipelinewithcontextdistillation(Askell\\netal.,2021b). Thisinvolvesgeneratingsafermodelresponsesbyprefixingapromptwithasafety\\npreprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentially distillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. Weuseatargetedapproachthatallowsoursafetyrewardmodeltochoosewhethertouse\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreateadversarialpromptsalongtwodimensions: a riskcategory ,orpotentialtopicaboutwhichtheLLM\\ncouldproduceunsafecontent;andan attackvector ,orquestionstyletocoverdifferentvarietiesofprompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nTheriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal\\nactivities (e.g.,terrorism,theft,humantrafficking); hatefulandharmfulactivities (e.g.,defamation,self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/genai_data/Llama-2.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk.

Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1 Learnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such as Llama 2-Chat ’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\nReward Model ScoreRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions of Llama 2-Chat , from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEvenwithproficientannotators,eachindividualwriteswithsignificantvariation.

Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTooptimizeforlatency,wehostourlargestmodelsusing8A100sinasinglenodewithtensorparallelism\\n(Shoeybietal.,2019).

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreferencedata(i.e.,MetaSafety+Helpfulness)onaweeklybasis,consistingofover1millionbinarymodel\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g., negligibly better or unsure ) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g., significantly better ) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterativemodelupdateandpreferencedataannotationprocedure-withbetter-performing Llama 2-Chat\\nmodelsusedforresponsesamplingovertime,itbecomeschallengingforannotatorstoselectabetterone\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT.

This was a deliberately\\nconservativeapproachinordertoproducea“clean”subsetofthedatawithhighprecision,andisusedin\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\netal.(2022),somedatasets(suchasBoolQ)containcontextsextractedverbatimfromtheweb,butnotthe\\nquestionandanswercontinuation. Assuch,highlycontaminatedsamplesfromthesedatasetsareunlikely\\ntogainanunfairadvantage. ThemethodologyinChowdheryetal.(2022)furtherimprovesontheearlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsidertheformattingofpromptsusedforactualevaluation. Incontrast,weinsteadmatchontokenized\\ninput,beingcarefultopassfullyverbalizedevaluationsamplestothetokenizer. Wealsodivergefromthe\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\ntobecontaminatedifitappearsinanytoken n-gramlongerthan10tokensinboththeevaluationsample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with <20%contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with >80%contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matchedspans between anevaluation sampleand the trainingdata can differin at mostfour positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\netal.(2022),modifiedtoworkonaPySparkcluster(effectivelywithoutrandomaccesstodisk). Giventhe\\nembarrassinglyparallelnatureofthetask,weareabletofindallsuch10-grams(andtheirfulllengths)in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributedtoevaluationperformance(mostlystemmingfromthefactthat\"clean\"and\"dirty\"subsetsdo\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhaveanoverall worseaveragescorethantheircomplement,andthe\"dirtiest\"samplestohaveanoverall better\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n•“Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n•“Not clean” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n•“Not dirty” samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n•“Dirty”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.\\nThereisanadditionalconfoundingfactorthatweattempttoaddressdirectly.

Testing conducted to date has been in\\nEnglish, and has notcovered, nor could it coverall scenarios. For these reasons, aswith all LLMs,\\nLlama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances\\nproduceinaccurateorobjectionableresponsestouserprompts. Therefore,beforedeployingany\\napplications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their\\nspecific applications of the model.

For these reasons, aswith all LLMs,\\nLlama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances\\nproduceinaccurateorobjectionableresponsestouserprompts. Therefore,beforedeployingany\\napplications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their\\nspecific applications of the model.
