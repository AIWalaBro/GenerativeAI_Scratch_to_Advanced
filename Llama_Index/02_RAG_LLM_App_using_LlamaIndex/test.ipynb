Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37].

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Most deep learning methods require substantial\\namounts of manually labeled data, which restricts their applicability in many domains that suffer\\nfrom a dearth of annotated resources [ 61]. In these situations, models that can leverage linguistic\\ninformation from unlabeled data provide a valuable alternative to gathering more annotation, which\\ncan be time-consuming and expensive. Further, even in cases where considerable supervision\\nis available, learning good representations in an unsupervised fashion can provide a signiﬁcant\\nperformance boost. The most compelling evidence for this so far has been the extensive use of pre-\\ntrained word embeddings [ 10,39,42] to improve performance on a range of NLP tasks [ 8,11,26,45].\\nLeveraging more than word-level information from unlabeled text, however, is challenging for two\\nmain reasons. First, it is unclear what type of optimization objectives are most effective at learning\\ntext representations that are useful for transfer. Recent research has looked at various objectives\\nsuch as language modeling [ 44], machine translation [ 38], and discourse coherence [ 22], with each\\nmethod outperforming the others on different tasks.1Second, there is no consensus on the most\\neffective way to transfer these learned representations to the target task. Existing techniques involve\\na combination of making task-speciﬁc changes to the model architecture [ 43,44], using intricate\\nlearning schemes [ 21] and adding auxiliary learning objectives [ 50]. These uncertainties have made\\nit difﬁcult to develop effective semi-supervised learning approaches for language processing.\\n1https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard\\nPreprint.

Our goal is to learn a universal\\nrepresentation that transfers with little adaptation to a wide range of tasks. We assume access to\\na large corpus of unlabeled text and several datasets with manually annotated training examples\\n(target tasks). Our setup does not require these target tasks to be in the same domain as the unlabeled\\ncorpus. We employ a two-stage training procedure. First, we use a language modeling objective on\\nthe unlabeled data to learn the initial parameters of a neural network model. Subsequently, we adapt\\nthese parameters to a target task using the corresponding supervised objective.\\nFor our model architecture, we use the Transformer [62], which has been shown to perform strongly on\\nvarious tasks such as machine translation [ 62], document generation [ 34], and syntactic parsing [ 29].\\nThis model choice provides us with a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies in\\ntext, compared to alternatives like recurrent networks, resulting in robust transfer performance across\\ndiverse tasks. During transfer, we utilize task-speciﬁc input adaptations derived from traversal-style\\napproaches [ 52], which process structured text input as a single contiguous sequence of tokens. As\\nwe demonstrate in our experiments, these adaptations enable us to ﬁne-tune effectively with minimal\\nchanges to the architecture of the pre-trained model.\\nWe evaluate our approach on four types of language understanding tasks – natural language inference,\\nquestion answering, semantic similarity, and text classiﬁcation. Our general task-agnostic model\\noutperforms discriminatively trained models that employ architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each\\ntask, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance,\\nwe achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test) [ 40],\\n5.7% on question answering (RACE) [ 30], 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI) [ 66] and 5.5% on\\nthe recently introduced GLUE multi-task benchmark [ 64]. We also analyzed zero-shot behaviors\\nof the pre-trained model on four different settings and demonstrate that it acquires useful linguistic\\nknowledge for downstream tasks.\\n2 Related Work\\nSemi-supervised learning for NLP Our work broadly falls under the category of semi-supervised\\nlearning for natural language. This paradigm has attracted signiﬁcant interest, with applications to\\ntasks like sequence labeling [ 24,33,57] or text classiﬁcation [ 41,70]. The earliest approaches used\\nunlabeled data to compute word-level or phrase-level statistics, which were then used as features in a\\nsupervised model [33]. Over the last few years, researchers have demonstrated the beneﬁts of using\\nword embeddings [ 11,39,42], which are trained on unlabeled corpora, to improve performance on a\\nvariety of tasks [ 8,11,26,45]. These approaches, however, mainly transfer word-level information,\\nwhereas we aim to capture higher-level semantics.\\nRecent approaches have investigated learning and utilizing more than word-level semantics from\\nunlabeled data. Phrase-level or sentence-level embeddings, which can be trained using an unlabeled\\ncorpus, have been used to encode text into suitable vector representations for various target tasks [ 28,\\n32, 1, 36, 22, 12, 56, 31].\\nUnsupervised pre-training Unsupervised pre-training is a special case of semi-supervised learning\\nwhere the goal is to ﬁnd a good initialization point instead of modifying the supervised learning\\nobjective. Early works explored the use of the technique in image classiﬁcation [ 20,49,63] and\\nregression tasks [ 3]. Subsequent research [ 15] demonstrated that pre-training acts as a regularization\\nscheme, enabling better generalization in deep neural networks. In recent work, the method has\\nbeen used to help train deep neural networks on various tasks like image classiﬁcation [ 69], speech\\nrecognition [68], entity disambiguation [17] and machine translation [48].\\nThe closest line of work to ours involves pre-training a neural network using a language modeling\\nobjective and then ﬁne-tuning it on a target task with supervision. Dai et al. [ 13] and Howard and\\nRuder [ 21] follow this method to improve text classiﬁcation. However, although the pre-training\\nphase helps capture some linguistic information, their usage of LSTM models restricts their prediction\\nability to a short range. In contrast, our choice of transformer networks allows us to capture longer-\\nrange linguistic structure, as demonstrated in our experiments. Further, we also demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our model on a wider range of tasks including natural language inference, paraphrase\\ndetection and story completion.

Early work by Collobert and Weston [ 10] used a wide variety of\\nauxiliary NLP tasks such as POS tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and language modeling\\nto improve semantic role labeling. More recently, Rei [ 50] added an auxiliary language modeling\\nobjective to their target task objective and demonstrated performance gains on sequence labeling\\ntasks. Our experiments also use an auxiliary objective, but as we show, unsupervised pre-training\\nalready learns several linguistic aspects relevant to target tasks.\\n3 Framework\\nOur training procedure consists of two stages. The ﬁrst stage is learning a high-capacity language\\nmodel on a large corpus of text. This is followed by a ﬁne-tuning stage, where we adapt the model to\\na discriminative task with labeled data.\\n3.1 Unsupervised pre-training\\nGiven an unsupervised corpus of tokens U={u1,...,u n}, we use a standard language modeling\\nobjective to maximize the following likelihood:\\nL1(U) =∑\\nilogP(ui|ui−k,...,u i−1; Θ) (1)\\nwherekis the size of the context window, and the conditional probability Pis modeled using a neural\\nnetwork with parameters Θ. These parameters are trained using stochastic gradient descent [51].\\nIn our experiments, we use a multi-layer Transformer decoder [34] for the language model, which is\\na variant of the transformer [ 62]. This model applies a multi-headed self-attention operation over the\\ninput context tokens followed by position-wise feedforward layers to produce an output distribution\\nover target tokens:\\nh0=UWe+Wp\\nhl=transformer_block (hl−1)∀i∈[1,n]\\nP(u) =softmax (hnWT\\ne)(2)\\nwhereU= (u−k,...,u −1)is the context vector of tokens, nis the number of layers, Weis the token\\nembedding matrix, and Wpis the position embedding matrix.\\n3.2 Supervised ﬁne-tuning\\nAfter training the model with the objective in Eq. 1, we adapt the parameters to the supervised target\\ntask. We assume a labeled dataset C, where each instance consists of a sequence of input tokens,\\nx1,...,xm, along with a label y. The inputs are passed through our pre-trained model to obtain\\nthe ﬁnal transformer block’s activation hm\\nl, which is then fed into an added linear output layer with\\nparametersWyto predicty:\\nP(y|x1,...,xm) =softmax (hm\\nlWy). (3)\\nThis gives us the following objective to maximize:\\nL2(C) =∑\\n(x,y)logP(y|x1,...,xm). (4)\\nWe additionally found that including language modeling as an auxiliary objective to the ﬁne-tuning\\nhelped learning by (a) improving generalization of the supervised model, and (b) accelerating\\nconvergence. This is in line with prior work [ 50,43], who also observed improved performance with\\nsuch an auxiliary objective. Speciﬁcally, we optimize the following objective (with weight λ):\\nL3(C) =L2(C) +λ∗L1(C) (5)\\nOverall, the only extra parameters we require during ﬁne-tuning are Wy, and embeddings for delimiter\\ntokens (described below in Section 3.3).\\n3', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Since our pre-trained model\\nwas trained on contiguous sequences of text, we require some modiﬁcations to apply it to these tasks.\\nPrevious work proposed learning task speciﬁc architectures on top of transferred representations [ 44].\\nSuch an approach re-introduces a signiﬁcant amount of task-speciﬁc customization and does not\\nuse transfer learning for these additional architectural components. Instead, we use a traversal-style\\napproach [ 52], where we convert structured inputs into an ordered sequence that our pre-trained\\nmodel can process. These input transformations allow us to avoid making extensive changes to the\\narchitecture across tasks. We provide a brief description of these input transformations below and\\nFigure 1 provides a visual illustration. All transformations include adding randomly initialized start\\nand end tokens (⟨s⟩,⟨e⟩).\\nTextual entailment For entailment tasks, we concatenate the premise pand hypothesis htoken\\nsequences, with a delimiter token ( $) in between.\\nSimilarity For similarity tasks, there is no inherent ordering of the two sentences being compared.\\nTo reﬂect this, we modify the input sequence to contain both possible sentence orderings (with a\\ndelimiter in between) and process each independently to produce two sequence representations hm\\nl\\nwhich are added element-wise before being fed into the linear output layer.\\nQuestion Answering and Commonsense Reasoning For these tasks, we are given a context\\ndocumentz, a questionq, and a set of possible answers {ak}. We concatenate the document context\\nand question with each possible answer, adding a delimiter token in between to get [z;q; $;ak]. Each\\nof these sequences are processed independently with our model and then normalized via a softmax\\nlayer to produce an output distribution over possible answers.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Setup\\nUnsupervised pre-training We use the BooksCorpus dataset [ 71] for training the language model.\\nIt contains over 7,000 unique unpublished books from a variety of genres including Adventure,\\nFantasy, and Romance.

Although there has been a lot of\\nrecent interest [ 58,35,44], the task remains challenging due to the presence of a wide variety of\\nphenomena like lexical entailment, coreference, and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. We evaluate\\non ﬁve datasets with diverse sources, including image captions (SNLI), transcribed speech, popular\\nﬁction, and government reports (MNLI), Wikipedia articles (QNLI), science exams (SciTail) or news\\narticles (RTE).\\nTable 2 details various results on the different NLI tasks for our model and previous state-of-the-art\\napproaches.

On RTE, one of the smaller datasets we\\nevaluate on (2490 examples), we achieve an accuracy of 56%, which is below the 61.7% reported by a\\nmulti-task biLSTM model.

We use the recently released RACE dataset [ 30],\\nconsisting of English passages with associated questions from middle and high school exams. This\\ncorpus has been shown to contain more reasoning type questions that other datasets like CNN [ 19] or\\nSQuaD [ 47], providing the perfect evaluation for our model which is trained to handle long-range\\ncontexts. In addition, we evaluate on the Story Cloze Test [ 40], which involves selecting the correct\\nending to multi-sentence stories from two options. On these tasks, our model again outperforms the\\nprevious best results by signiﬁcant margins - up to 8.9% on Story Cloze, and 5.7% overall on RACE.\\nThis demonstrates the ability of our model to handle long-range contexts effectively.\\nSemantic Similarity Semantic similarity (or paraphrase detection) tasks involve predicting whether\\ntwo sentences are semantically equivalent or not. The challenges lie in recognizing rephrasing of\\nconcepts, understanding negation, and handling syntactic ambiguity. We use three datasets for this\\ntask – the Microsoft Paraphrase corpus (MRPC) [ 14] (collected from news sources), the Quora\\nQuestion Pairs (QQP) dataset [ 9], and the Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark (STS-B) [ 6].\\nWe obtain state-of-the-art results on two of the three semantic similarity tasks (Table 4) with a 1\\npoint absolute gain on STS-B. The performance delta on QQP is signiﬁcant, with a 4.2% absolute\\nimprovement over Single-task BiLSTM + ELMo + Attn.\\nClassiﬁcation Finally, we also evaluate on two different text classiﬁcation tasks. The Corpus\\nof Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) [ 65] contains expert judgements on whether a sentence is\\ngrammatical or not, and tests the innate linguistic bias of trained models. The Stanford Sentiment\\nTreebank (SST-2) [ 54], on the other hand, is a standard binary classiﬁcation task. Our model obtains\\nan score of 45.4 on CoLA, which is an especially big jump over the previous best result of 35.0,\\nshowcasing the innate linguistic bias learned by our model. The model also achieves 91.3% accuracy\\non SST-2, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art results. We also achieve an overall score of\\n72.8 on the GLUE benchmark, which is signiﬁcantly better than the previous best of 68.9.\\n6', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Figure 2(left) illustrates the\\nperformance of our approach on MultiNLI and RACE as a function of the number of layers transferred.\\nWe observe the standard result that transferring embeddings improves performance and that each\\ntransformer layer provides further beneﬁts up to 9% for full transfer on MultiNLI. This indicates that\\neach layer in the pre-trained model contains useful functionality for solving target tasks.\\nFigure 2: ( left) Effect of transferring increasing number of layers from the pre-trained language\\nmodel on RACE and MultiNLI.

We visualize the effectiveness of these heuristic solutions over the course of generative\\npre-training in Fig 2(right). We observe the performance of these heuristics is stable and steadily\\nincreases over training suggesting that generative pretraining supports the learning of a wide variety\\nof task relevant functionality. We also observe the LSTM exhibits higher variance in its zero-shot\\nperformance suggesting that the inductive bias of the Transformer architecture assists in transfer.\\nFor CoLA (linguistic acceptability), examples are scored as the average token log-probability the\\ngenerative model assigns and predictions are made by thresholding. For SST-2 (sentiment analysis),\\nwe append the token very to each example and restrict the language model’s output distribution to only\\nthe words positive andnegative and guess the token it assigns higher probability to as the prediction.\\nFor RACE (question answering), we pick the answer the generative model assigns the highest average\\ntoken log-probability when conditioned on the document and question. For DPRD [ 46] (winograd\\nschemas), we replace the deﬁnite pronoun with the two possible referrents and predict the resolution\\nthat the generative model assigns higher average token log-probability to the rest of the sequence\\nafter the substitution.\\nAblation studies We perform three different ablation studies (Table 5). First, we examine the\\nperformance of our method without the auxiliary LM objective during ﬁne-tuning. We observe that\\nthe auxiliary objective helps on the NLI tasks and QQP. Overall, the trend suggests that larger datasets\\nbeneﬁt from the auxiliary objective but smaller datasets do not. Second, we analyze the effect of the\\nTransformer by comparing it with a single layer 2048 unit LSTM using the same framework. We\\nobserve a 5.6 average score drop when using the LSTM instead of the Transformer. The LSTM only\\noutperforms the Transformer on one dataset – MRPC. Finally, we also compare with our transformer\\narchitecture directly trained on supervised target tasks, without pre-training. We observe that the lack\\nof pre-training hurts performance across all the tasks, resulting in a 14.8% decrease compared to our\\nfull model.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe introduced a framework for achieving strong natural language understanding with a single\\ntask-agnostic model through generative pre-training and discriminative ﬁne-tuning. By pre-training\\non a diverse corpus with long stretches of contiguous text our model acquires signiﬁcant world\\nknowledge and ability to process long-range dependencies which are then successfully transferred to\\nsolving discriminative tasks such as question answering, semantic similarity assessment, entailment\\ndetermination, and text classiﬁcation, improving the state of the art on 9 of the 12 datasets we\\nstudy. Using unsupervised (pre-)training to boost performance on discriminative tasks has long\\nbeen an important goal of Machine Learning research. Our work suggests that achieving signiﬁcant\\nperformance gains is indeed possible, and offers hints as to what models (Transformers) and data sets\\n(text with long range dependencies) work best with this approach. We hope that this will help enable\\nnew research into unsupervised learning, for both natural language understanding and other domains,\\nfurther improving our understanding of how and when unsupervised learning works.\\nReferences\\n[1] S.
